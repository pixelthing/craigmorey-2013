    %h2 An experiment into dev-client communication

    .cm-work-main
      
      %p Sometimes the communication between the team building the website and the client sucks. It's not normally anyone's fault, it's just hard to get the right people together in front of the the development website at the right time.

      %p Bangnotes were networked stickies for website development. You have conversations on notes pasted next to the feature on the page you want to talk about. The idea was that you could then turn this collection of notes into a to-do list and even hook it into your favourite project management web-app. 

      %p It was a project management system that was closely tied to the visual context of the thing you were building.

      %p Anyway - that was back in 2010, and it never got off the ground. Not least because "responsive design" made pasting notes on a feature - and expecting that feature to stay in the same place - a nonsense.
