<p>MindWorks is the European hub for press materials for Suzuki Marine. That means controlling and dishing out imagery and press releases from the Med to the Baltic, and this was the website we built to do the job. It was conceived with an interface built around many languages, and a back-end that allowed the account team to manage a gallery of hundreds of images and press release translations.</p>

<p>My favourite touch is in image gallery, where mousing over the thumbnails brings up pop-up surrounds that allow direct access to all the different downloads - that's one less click eliminated, and one less barrier for a journalist writing an article on the Suzuki's products.</p>
