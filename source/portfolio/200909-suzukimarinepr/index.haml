      %p MindWorks Marketing runs the European hub for Suzuki Marine press materials. That means controlling and dishing out imagery and press releases to territories from the Med to the Baltic, and this was the website we built to do the job. It was conceived with an interface built around many languages, and a back-end that allowed the account team to manage a gallery of hundreds of images and press release translations.

      %p My favourite touch is in image gallery, where mousing over the thumbnails reveals pop-ups that allow direct access to all the different downloads - that's one less click eliminated if you need to download many images, and one less barrier for a journalist writing an article on the Suzuki's products.
