The user experience of checkout pages is still pretty bad on the web, I was determined not to make this one of them." /></a>

<p>Powertraveller manufacture and sell consumer electrical items, specialising in portable battery chargers. This is actually the third generation of Powertraveller website I'd been involved in, but all previous ones had been based within, or extending, the Actinic eCommerce solution. Actinic is clever stuff focused on small businesses, but from the point of a web developer/designer, it's a hateful experience…</p>

<p>This generation of the site was the first that allowed my to build my own shop and payment back-end. I tried to take all the best practices of the moment to give a user experience that felt easy and trust-worthy to a customer. Never forcing them to register a username and password (hate that), never updating the basket without making it clear what's happened (hate that), and explaining things like the postage cost in the checkout.</p>

<p>Something must have gone right, because three years on it still takes many thousands of pounds of orders every month…</p>
