<p>Brockenhurst College is a large further education college in the New Forest, with around 4000 full-time and part-time students. It was a large project that I had to tie in with a brand refresh that was being carried out by another agency. There were to be a large amount of web site administrators, that as well as needing training, also needed access to different areas of the website. As part of a team I helped co-ordinate the large task of creating the shell and the content, as well as leading design and coding.</p>

<p>But the most interesting part of the project was the dealing with traffic issues. In it's first winter, there were several days of snow and the college administration told the student body to check the website at 7pm to see what decision was taken about opening the college the following day. In the minutes before 7pm, two thousand students tried to get to the homepage, the site and the server became overloaded with traffic, leading to many people failing to load the site, and keep hitting refresh, adding to the problem.</p>

<p>In all, we had 30,000 page views in the course of 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The next morning I'd written my first page and query caching system. But not only that, I'd built a "crisis homepage", a passworded script which made no database calls and allowed administrators to set up a simple temporary homepage for instances such as snow days and get the information out to a much greater amount of people. The following two years also had snow days with google analytics showing massive traffic spikes - with no loss of service to any visitor.</p>

<p>We also advised all clients from that point on to never inform four thousand people to visit a website at the same timeâ€¦</p>
