    %h2 A lesson in traffic peaks

    .cm-work-main
      
      %p Brockenhurst College is a large further education college in the New Forest, with around 4000 full-time and part-time students. It was a large project that I had to tie in with a brand refresh that was being carried out by seperate agency. There were to be a large amount of web site administrators so as well as building we had to consider training too. As part of the project team I helped co-ordinate the task of structuring the information architecture then building the CMS and templates, as well as being involved in the design and content.

      %p The most interesting part of the project came much later, when we had to deal with peak traffic issues. In it's first winter, heavy snow was forcast and the college administration informed the students to check the website at 7pm to see what if the college would open it's doors the following day. In the minutes before 7pm, two thousand students simultaneously tried to get to the homepage and the site and the server became overloaded with traffic. This lead to many people failing to load the site, who of course kept hitting refresh, adding to our problems.

      %p In all, we had 30,000 page view attempts in the course of 15 minutes, on a server built to deal with a 1000.

      %p The next morning we'd written our first page and query caching system. But not only that, we'd built a "crisis homepage", a passworded script which made no database calls and allowed administrators to set up a simple temporary homepage for instances such as snow days and get the information out to a much greater amount of people. The following two years also had snow days where google analytics showing massive traffic spikes - but with no loss of service to any visitor.

      %p We also advised all clients from that point on to never inform four thousand people to visit a website at the same timeâ€¦
