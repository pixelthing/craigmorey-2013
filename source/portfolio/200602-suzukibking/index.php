<p>The B-King is a monster Suzuki street bike - and as if that wasn't exciting enough, MindWorks as an agency had some early press material on it pre-launch. Suzuki wanted some buzz about the product and with a the grand total of two small pictures and the name (that's all we had), I designed a small teaser flash site within a couple of days. It hit all the right notes in the industry and journalists, and 50% of visits were from the USA, where there were no details released up to that point.</p>

<p>Suzuki commissioned a follow up with a tiny snippet of video, some more imagery and a contact form, and that generated even more traffic. It was probably my last major project that was built in Flash, but still holds up as a small piece of work that I'm proud of - and that's all down to keeping the scope small and the polish high.</p>
