I might have picked up on the word 'edgey' a bit heavily here..." /></a>
				<a href="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic2.jpg" class="child_detail_img"><img src="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic2s.jpg" alt="" title="Second concept" rel="After feedback, this swung to a more grungy theme - all the time I was thinking how to take square-cut pictures out of the CMS and mask them up to give the right effect." /></a>
				<a href="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic3.jpg" class="child_detail_img"><img src="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic3s.jpg" alt="" title="Final concept" rel="The final design stepped back a bit from the two initial concepts, but still injected a bit more personality into a simpler box/column site. Then I had to invent a javascript method to add that ragged edge to the photos." /></a>
				<a href="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic4.jpg" class="child_detail_img"><img src="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic4s.jpg" alt="" title="Product page" rel="The final catalogue had precise filtering, multiple pictures (with a magnifying glass zoom) and lots of little information pop-ups to make details like the postage cost, size and price conversion clear. I really wanted the photos to be more interesting than just a 't-shirt on the floor', and the girls really took it on board, making each shot interesting as well as useful - I believe most of this 'second-hand' photography beats the brands' original studio shots." /></a>
				<a href="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic5.jpg" class="child_detail_img"><img src="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic5s.jpg" alt="" title="Print-out" rel="So often forgotten, I always make the effort to tweak how key pages are printed out - asking myself, 'If I was given this piece of paper alone, would I be able to find the page on the web?'" /></a>
				<a href="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic6.jpg" class="child_detail_img"><img src="portfolio/m200911_fab/pic6s.jpg" alt="" title="Mobile stylesheet" rel="It's funny making a responsive design. You see a site on a screen all day, but holding the site in your hand on a gorgeous small screen like this makes you feel even more proud. The whole shop, from home to product to checkout is all available through the mobile stylesheet." /></a>

<p>Fabulous and Poor is a Stockholm shop specialising in recycling and resale of ski and sports-wear. Yep. Not your average brief. So we were tasked with helping them through the process of not only setting up an online store in multiple languages, but also to understand and refine their workflow, marking up and photographing goods, managing and paying out to sellers.</p>

<p>Having a background in systems design helped me analyse their processes and translate them in a way they could be documented and replicated in an online system. And understanding a bit about the language and culture didn't hurt either (my partner is from Gothenburg). A site visit with a couple of days discussing every aspect of the job was invaluable - I'm against endless meetings, but you can't beat thrashing out the details with all the team in the room to get everyone enthused about the task.</p>

<p>The design started at the electro pop end of the scale, going through a grunge period, then finalising on a decent compromise. I loved stretching the design a bit to see what the client wanted - makes a change from the more conservative "three column - make it white" initial brief you often get.</p>

<p>Building multi-language capabilities into the site without having to just build three separate sites was a good challenge, as was building a shop with a Swedish third party payment system paying in Krona. The product pages all had magnifying glasses, and F&P took to photographing the stock in a way that made the whole thing exciting (again, another project that really lives through the quality of it's content).</p>

<p>This was my first responsive design released in the wild (as oppose to a mobile template which I'd done before), and a shop at that. Finding that responsive design was no mystery if you keep it in mind during the design stage was a great feeling, and I guess I promised myself that all sites I built would be responsive to some extent in the future...</p>
