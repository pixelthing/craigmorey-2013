    %h2 A multi language sportsware system

    .cm-work-main
      
      %p Fabulous and Poor is a Stockholm shop specialising in recycling and resale of ski and sports-wear. Yep. Not your average brief. So we were tasked with helping them through the process of not only setting up an online store in multiple languages, but also to understand and refine their workflow, marking up and photographing goods, managing and paying out to sellers.

      %p Having a background in systems design helped me analyse their processes and translate them in a way they could be documented and replicated in an online system. And understanding a bit about the language and culture didn't hurt either (my partner is from Gothenburg). A site visit with a couple of days discussing every aspect of the job was invaluable - I'm against endless meetings, but you can't beat thrashing out the details with all the team in the room to get everyone enthused about the task.

      %p The design started at the electro pop end of the scale, going through a grunge period, then finalising on a decent compromise. I loved stretching the design a bit to see what the client wanted - makes a change from the more conservative "three column - make it white" initial brief you often get.

      %p Building multi-language capabilities into the site without having to just build three separate sites was a good challenge, as was building a shop with a Swedish third party payment system paying in Krona. The product pages all had magnifying glasses, and F&P took to photographing the stock in a way that made the whole thing exciting (again, another project that really lives through the quality of it's content).

      %p This was my first responsive design released in the wild (as oppose to a mobile only template which I'd done before), and on top of that you had to be able to purchase through it. Finding that responsive design was no mystery if you keep it in mind during the design stage was a great feeling, and I guess I promised myself that all sites I built would be responsive to some extent in the future...
