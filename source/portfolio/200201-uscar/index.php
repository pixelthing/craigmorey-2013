<p>USCAR is a US government agency that is funded by the car industry to investigate new technologies. I know, geek heaven. After striking up a relationship with them during my contract at Engenuity, this was my first freelance job after that project, leading to three separate jobs for them. I still look back on them and wondered how I had no fear in taking them on.</p>

<p>The first was V-Room (They loved all those crazy names), a file extranet that was based on Engenuity's system. The second was the huge "Request for Purchase Order" (RFPO) system, a monster to plan and implement, allowing employees to generate their own electronic purchase orders that would go through pre-determined sign-off list, depending on many criteria including team structure and outlay. The last project was a resource booking calendar - well before Google Calendar came along, with lots of functionality and design touches such as allowing overlapping events to remain visible.</p>
