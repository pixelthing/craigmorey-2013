    %h2 A trans-atlantic intranet project

      %p USCAR is a US government agency that is funded by the car industry to investigate new technologies. To me it was geek heaven. After striking up a relationship with them during my contract at Engenuity this was my first freelance job, leading to three separate projects for them, each with a tough brief - especially for 2002.

      %p The first was V-Room (not my name choice), a file extranet based on Engenuity's system. The second was the huge "Request for Purchase Order" (RFPO) system, allowing employees to generate their own PDF electronic purchase orders that would go through a auto-generated sign-off process, depending on many criteria including team structure and cost. For RFPO, more work was needed to unpick the companies actual requirements, workflow and stakeholders than building the code itself. The last project was a resource booking calendar - years before Google Calendar came along, with lots of functionality and design touches such as allowing overlapping events to remain visible.

      %p This work really used my background in systems analysis and design to the max. Over a decade later I realise this was the very definition of UX design today.
