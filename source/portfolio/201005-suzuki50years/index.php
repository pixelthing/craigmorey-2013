<p>The Suzuki 50 years of racing microsite was my life for a short time. It was hugely ambitious, not only technically but also in terms of content.</p>

<p>It was a microsite that was created to celebrate the riders, the machines and the passion for half a century of Suzuki motorcycle racing, and I was determined to move away from the obvious route - a flash website. But to cap it off, I wanted to make it work on the iPad, to make it feel like you want to sink into a comfy seat with a tablet and flick through the site, whilst also feeling polished on a regular computer browser.</p>

<p>Bare in mind that this was early 2010. The iPad wasn't even out in the UK. We built the bulk of the site in the MacOS simulator, before I bought an iPad from the 'States with my own money to start testing on the real thing.</p>

<p>That's when the scale of the job became apparent. What worked on the simulator - with it's desktop processor, graphics power and huge memory - looked stuttery and buggy in the real, resource constrained iPad. What followed was a huge learning curve compressed into a few short weeks, in graphics acceleration, memory management, touch controls and other skills.</p>

<p>At the same time, I wanted to add real value to the site, not just a geeky interest, so we sourced as much content as we could find from the client, from contacting Flickr users to use their photos, embedding YouTube videos and writing lots of copy that we hoped would hold an enthusiast's interest.</p>

<p>It would be built so differently if we started it today with all we've learnt, but pulling it off was a huge buzz and launching it on the same day as the iPad came out in the UK? Priceless.</p>
