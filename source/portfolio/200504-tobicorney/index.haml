      %p Tobi Corney wanted a website for his portfolio as a professional photographer. working with the excellent design agency Gibson, I took the original designs and ideas for animated slideshows and decided to do the unthinkable in 2005â€¦

      %p Not build it in Flash.

      %p Before the time of HTML5, Canvas, heck, even jQuery, this meant quite a bit of experimenting with javascript. But it paid off. We had a site that was SEO friendly, easy to manage with a basic CMS behind it, and one that is still working after seven years in the wild.
